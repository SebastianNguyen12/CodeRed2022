<img src="production_consumption China.png" alt="" width="" height="" />
<p>China consumed 15.3 million b/d of petroleum and other liquids in 2021, an increase of 840,000 b/d or around 6% from 2020.The greatest percentages of oil products consumed since 2000 were diesel (24%) and gasoline (23%) respectively. However, since 2015, the rate of growth in the transportation sector's oil demand has slowed. 21 The primary forces behind a general decline in oil use for transportation in 2020 were as follows: China's lockdown measures in response to COVID-19 and economic slowdowns</p>
<p>China is the world's most populated nation and one with a rapidly expanding economy. In 2020, it ranked first in both energy production and consumption worldwide. Due to months-long lockdowns in various locations, which forced refiners to reduce operations, China's demand for fuel has hurt the oil industry. In comparison to a year before, China's natural gas consumption climbed by 5.5% from July to December. The total gas demand for 2022 has increased as a result of this catastrophe to between 380 and 390 billion cubic meters. In the first half of 2022, production at PetroChina's refinery fell 1.4% to 597.5 million barrels. Sales of gasoline, diesel, and kerosene decreased by 11.1% to 71.43 tonnes as a result. However, the company has been able to recover because of an increase in its oil and gas output as well as higher energy prices.</p>
