<p>ExxonMobile produced 2.3 barrels of liquid daily in 2021. This was less than the business's daily output or production in 2020, which was close to 2.35 barrels. The corporation suffered with the low prices of oil and transportation fuel after the COVID-19 pandemic, which is what contributed to the 2020 drop.</p>
