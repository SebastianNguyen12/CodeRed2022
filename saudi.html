<p>As of 2018, Saudi Arabia's oil and gas production has started out poorly. Given that Iran is the world's top producer of crude oil, its low output levels have had a significant impact on the global oil market. But starting in 2020, their total petroleum liquid production started to climb everyday, finally reaching a record level in April. As gas production declined at the same time, more crude oil and fuel oil were used to produce electricity. Saudi Arabia is the largest consumer of crude oil in the Middle East, and as a result, daily consumption of crude oil and petroleum products has decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's total output of crude oil and other natural gas has decreased since 2018, when it reached 2.1 million barrels per day. Since Saudi Arabia has the highest capacity for producing crude oil in the world, it has an impact on the worldwide market by quickly raising and reducing its oil output, which was 9.2 for crude oil and 1.6 for non-crude oil on average. In 2020, there were 10.8 million total petroleum liquids produced daily. With 11.6 million barrels produced in April 2020, oil production reached a record high. Global oil demand is falling, and with it Saudi Arabia's ability to export crude oil. Gas production is also falling, and the world is using more crude oil and fuel oil to generate electricity. Saudi Arabia, the biggest user of crude oil in the Middle East, reduced its daily consumption of petroleum products and crude oil from 3.1 million to around 2.9 million barrels, principally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its concomitant economic and industrial difficulties. The results showed that gasoline and jet fuel usage significantly decreased. As a result, jet fuel and gasoline prices fell as a result of the increased demand for fuel oil in the power industry. </p>
